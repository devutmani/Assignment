The wrong value is displayed because the number 3000000000 is too large for a 32-bit int,
which can only store values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.
This causes integer overflow, wrapping the value into a negative number, resulting in incorrect output.
To fix this, use a larger data type like long long int that can handle bigger numbers
